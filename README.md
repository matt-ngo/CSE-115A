#### Setup

Install the current LTS version of Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Note that node.js includes the Node Package Manager npm.
Check version of node and npm with `$ node --version` and `$ npm --version`

Navigate to the SPLITR folder and run the following command: `$ npm install`

This will take some time to execute as npm downloads and installs all the packages required to build the project.

To start the dev server, run the following command: `$ npm start`

A new browser window will open where the project can be viewed.
